         Hello there, I'm a young enthusiast hailing from the heart of Warsaw, navigating the realms of code and sound.<bR/>
          My days are a dance with lines of code, while nights transform Fl Studio 21 into my musical laboratory.<BR/> With fervor, I pursue dreams of becoming a programmer and web developer, crafting my own soundscapes along the way.
         
       
 
        <p >In the hustle of the capital, I prioritize uniqueness, striving to find harmony between code and melody.<br>My portfolio is an attempt to capture this equilibrium - a blend of programming finesse and musical symphonies. <br>I invite you to listen, observe, and witness how these dual passions intertwine in my life. Your insights are eagerly awaited. <br>

             Photography is my small passion that intertwines with my creative endeavors. <br> Occasionally, I embark on photo walks, exploring the world through the lens of my camera. <br>It's a moment of tranquility and inspiration, capturing the beauty and essence of life in still frames. <br>In those moments, the shutter click becomes a harmonious melody, complementing my love for both visual and auditory arts. <br>
